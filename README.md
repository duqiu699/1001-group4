# Introduction
 For airlines, the most important thing is profitability. Therefore, they are committed to using various methods to enhance the benefits of their routes. This project aims to identify corresponding methods that can improve route profitability through different tasks.
# Task 1

In the following task, we will find an approciate aircraft model that achieve minimum cost for each scenario for the challenge assigned to our group.

First of all, we are going to find the shortest route from the departure point to arrival point in our group's obstacle set, then determine the aircraft type for each scenario to achieve minimum cost while satisfying passenger needs.

The aircraft type we have:
1. A321neo
2. A330-900neo
3. A350-900

First, the obstacle set for our group:

By editing the python programme, we can find the shortest way:

To find the minimum cost, we have to use to following formula:

 The 3 scenario:

1.  Scenario 1:
    - 3000 passengers travel within 1 week.
    - 12 flights maximum for one week
    - Time cost= Medium and Fuel Cost= 0.76 $/kg.

2.  Scenario 2:
    - 1250 passengers travel within 1 month.
    - 5 flights maximum for one week
    - Time cost= High and Fuel Cost= 0.88 $/kg.

3.  Scenario 3:
    - 2500 passengers travel within 1 week.
    - 25 flights maximum for one week
    - Time cost= low and Fuel Cost= 0.95 $/kg.

### Conclusion:
 * For scenario 1,the aircraft with the lowest operation cost is <ins></ins>, it can conduct the amount of flight is <ins></ins>.
 * For scenario 2,the aircraft with the lowest operation cost is <ins></ins>, it can conduct the amount of flight is <ins></ins>.
 * For scenario 3,the aircraft with the lowest operation cost is <ins></ins>, it can conduct the amount of flight is <ins></ins>.
